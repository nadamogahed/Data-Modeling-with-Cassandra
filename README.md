# Data-Modeling-with-Cassandra
- A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.
### Project Overview:
- In this project, is data modeling with Apache Cassandra and an ETL pipeline using Python.
- To model the data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries.
- provided with part of the ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.
# Data Modeling with Cassandra

This project is about data modeling with Apache Cassandra and completing an ETL pipeline using Python. 

## Project Overview

The project deals with a hypothetical startup called Sparkify that wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.

## Dataset

The dataset is a collection of CSV files partitioned by date. Here are examples of filepaths to two files in the dataset:

- `event_data/2018-11-08-events.csv`
- `event_data/2018-11-09-events.csv`

## Files

- `Project_1B_Project_Template.ipynb` : The Jupyter notebook that contains the ETL pipeline.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Apache Cassandra

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary packages.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook.
